          Hivemind Solutions was founded with a simple but powerful idea: that
          every business deserves access to enterprise-grade Microsoft
          technology, implemented by people who genuinely care about outcomes.


          Based in Adelaide, we've grown from a small consultancy into a trusted
          partner for organisations across South Australia. Our team combines
          deep technical expertise with a genuine passion for solving complex
          problems.


          We specialise in Microsoft 365, Azure, Intune, and Entra ID—the four
          pillars that power modern workplaces. Whether you're migrating to the
          cloud, securing your endpoints, or optimising your existing
          environment, we bring the expertise to make it happen.
