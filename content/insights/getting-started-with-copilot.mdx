## Why Copilot Matters for Your Business

Microsoft Copilot represents a fundamental shift in how we interact with productivity tools. By embedding AI directly into the Microsoft 365 apps your team already uses, Copilot can dramatically reduce time spent on routine tasks while improving the quality of outputs.

## Before You Begin: Prerequisites

Before rolling out Copilot, ensure your organisation has:

- **Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 licenses** (or equivalent)
- **Copilot for Microsoft 365 licenses** for each user
- **Azure AD properly configured** with appropriate security policies
- **Data governance policies** in place (Copilot can access what users can access)

## Rolling Out Copilot: A Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Pilot Group (Weeks 1-4)

Start with a small group of enthusiastic early adopters. Select 10-20 users across different departments who are:

- Comfortable with technology
- Willing to provide feedback
- Representative of your broader user base

### Phase 2: Department Rollout (Weeks 5-8)

Expand to entire departments based on pilot learnings. Focus on teams that will see the most immediate benefit, such as:

- Marketing teams (content creation)
- Sales teams (email and proposal writing)
- HR teams (policy documentation)

### Phase 3: Organisation-Wide (Weeks 9-12)

Complete the rollout with comprehensive training and support resources in place.

## Training Best Practices

Effective Copilot adoption requires more than just turning on licenses. Consider:

1. **Hands-on workshops** demonstrating real-world use cases
2. **Department-specific training** tailored to each team's workflows
3. **Prompt engineering basics** to help users get better results
4. **Regular check-ins** to address questions and share tips

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to measure your Copilot ROI:

- Time saved on document creation
- Meeting summary adoption rates
- User satisfaction scores
- Reduction in repetitive tasks

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Rushing the rollout** without proper training
- **Ignoring data governance** considerations
- **Setting unrealistic expectations** about AI capabilities
- **Failing to gather feedback** from users
