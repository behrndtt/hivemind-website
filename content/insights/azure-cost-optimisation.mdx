## Why Azure Costs Spiral

We've seen it countless times: organisations migrate to Azure expecting cost savings, only to find their bills higher than anticipated. The good news? Most overspending is preventable with the right strategies.

## Quick Wins

### 1. Right-Size Your VMs

Over 70% of Azure VMs are over-provisioned. Use Azure Advisor to identify opportunities:

* **Review CPU and memory utilisation** over 30 days
* **Downsize underutilised VMs** one tier at a time
* **Consider B-series VMs** for variable workloads

### 2. Use Reserved Instances

Commit to 1 or 3-year terms for predictable workloads:

* **Save up to 72%** compared to pay-as-you-go
* **Exchange or cancel** with flexibility options
* **Start with production workloads** you know will run continuously

### 3. Shut Down Dev/Test Resources

Non-production resources don't need to run 24/7:

* **Implement auto-shutdown schedules** via Azure Automation
* **Use Azure DevTest Labs** for developer environments
* **Consider Azure Spot VMs** for fault-tolerant workloads

### 4. Optimise Storage

Storage costs accumulate quickly:

* **Move cold data** to Archive tier
* **Delete orphaned disks** and snapshots
* **Review blob lifecycle policies**

## Governance Strategies

### Implement Budgets and Alerts

* Set budgets at the subscription and resource group level
* Configure alerts at 50%, 75%, and 90% thresholds
* Review spending weekly with stakeholders

### Use Tags Consistently

* Tag resources with cost centre, environment, and owner
* Run monthly reports by tag to identify trends
* Automate tag enforcement with Azure Policy

## Long-Term Optimisation

* **Consider Azure Hybrid Benefit** for Windows Server and SQL
* **Evaluate PaaS alternatives** to IaaS workloads
* **Review architecture** for serverless opportunities
