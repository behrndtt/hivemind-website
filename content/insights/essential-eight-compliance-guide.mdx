## What is the Essential Eight?

The Essential Eight is a set of baseline mitigation strategies developed by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). Originally designed for Australian government agencies, these strategies have become the gold standard for cybersecurity across all sectors.

## The Eight Strategies

### 1. Application Control

Prevent execution of unapproved programs. Microsoft solutions include:

- **Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)**
- **AppLocker policies** via Group Policy or Intune

### 2. Patch Applications

Keep applications up to date. Leverage:

- **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** for application updates
- **Windows Update for Business** for automatic patching

### 3. Configure Microsoft Office Macro Settings

Block macros from the internet. Use:

- **Attack Surface Reduction rules** in Microsoft Defender
- **Office cloud policy service** for consistent settings

### 4. User Application Hardening

Block web ads, Java, and Flash. Implement:

- **Microsoft Edge security policies**
- **Defender SmartScreen** for browser protection

### 5. Restrict Administrative Privileges

Limit admin access. Use:

- **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**
- **Just-in-time admin access** policies

### 6. Patch Operating Systems

Keep Windows updated. Deploy:

- **Windows Autopatch** for automated updates
- **Update compliance reporting** via Intune

### 7. Multi-Factor Authentication

Require MFA everywhere. Implement:

- **Azure AD Conditional Access**
- **Microsoft Authenticator** app

### 8. Regular Backups

Protect against ransomware. Use:

- **Microsoft 365 retention policies**
- **Azure Backup** for comprehensive protection

## Achieving Compliance

Most organisations can achieve Essential Eight Maturity Level 2 using native Microsoft 365 and Azure tools. Our team can assess your current state and create a roadmap to compliance.
