## The Client

Allied Health Group is a multi-site allied health provider operating across metropolitan Adelaide. With over 150 staff across physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech pathology services, they needed a modern IT environment that could support their growth while meeting strict healthcare compliance requirements.

## The Challenge

Allied Health Group was operating on legacy on-premises infrastructure with outdated security practices. Their existing environment presented several critical issues:

- **Aging Exchange Server** requiring constant maintenance and presenting security risks
- **No mobile device management** leaving patient data vulnerable on staff devices
- **Manual patch management** resulting in inconsistent security updates
- **Limited remote work capability** impacting staff flexibility and recruitment

They needed to modernise their IT environment while meeting Essential Eight compliance requirements mandated by their healthcare industry partners.

## Our Solution

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

- Mapped data governance requirements for healthcare
- Designed migration approach with zero tolerance for downtime
- Created Essential Eight compliance roadmap

### Phase 2: Microsoft 365 Deployment

- Migrated all mailboxes to Exchange Online with hybrid coexistence
- Deployed SharePoint Online for document management
- Implemented Microsoft Teams for clinical collaboration
- Configured retention policies for healthcare compliance

### Phase 3: Intune and Security

- Enrolled all devices in Microsoft Intune
- Deployed Windows Autopilot for streamlined device provisioning
- Implemented Conditional Access policies
- Configured Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

### Phase 4: Essential Eight Implementation

- Deployed application control via WDAC
- Configured automated patching for OS and applications
- Implemented MFA across all user accounts
- Established comprehensive backup strategy

## The Results

The transformation delivered measurable improvements across all key metrics:

- **Zero downtime** during the entire migration process

- **3 weeks** from project start to full deployment
