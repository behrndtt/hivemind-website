## The Client

SA Manufacturing Co is a mid-sized manufacturing company based in Adelaide's northern suburbs. With 200+ employees across production, logistics, and administration, they were struggling with aging on-premises infrastructure that couldn't keep pace with business demands.

## The Challenge

The company faced several infrastructure challenges impacting their operations:

- **End-of-life servers** running critical ERP and production systems
- **Limited disaster recovery** capability putting business continuity at risk
- **Siloed IT systems** preventing visibility across operations
- **High capital expenditure** cycle for hardware refreshes
- **No remote access** for management and administrative staff

## Our Solution

Hivemind designed a phased hybrid cloud migration that balanced cost, performance, and risk:

### Phase 1: Azure Foundation

- Deployed Azure Virtual Network with site-to-site VPN
- Established Azure Active Directory Connect for hybrid identity
- Implemented Azure Backup for critical on-premises workloads
- Set up Azure Monitor for unified infrastructure visibility

### Phase 2: Workload Migration

- Migrated file servers to Azure Files with on-premises caching
- Deployed domain controllers in Azure for redundancy
- Moved non-production ERP environments to Azure VMs
- Implemented Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery

### Phase 3: Optimisation

- Right-sized Azure VMs based on actual utilisation
- Implemented Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
- Deployed Azure Cost Management with departmental budgets
- Established governance policies via Azure Policy

## The Results

The hybrid cloud deployment delivered significant business outcomes:

- **35% reduction** in annual IT infrastructure costs
- **99.9% uptime** achieved with Azure-based redundancy
- **4-hour RTO** down from 48+ hours for disaster recovery
- **Enabled remote work** for all administrative staff

## Client Feedback

> "The move to Azure has transformed how we think about IT. We've gone from worrying about server failures to focusing on how technology can help us grow. Hivemind guided us through every step."
