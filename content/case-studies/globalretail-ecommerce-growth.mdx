GlobalRetail Co, a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer with over 200 physical stores, recognised the urgent need to strengthen their digital presence as consumer shopping habits shifted dramatically towards online channels.

## The Challenge

The company faced a critical juncture:

- **Outdated E-commerce Platform**: Slow, unreliable, and unable to handle traffic spikes
- **Poor Mobile Experience**: Only 20% of online traffic converted on mobile devices
- **Disconnected Inventory**: No real-time visibility between online and in-store stock
- **Limited Personalisation**: Generic shopping experience for all customers

## The Solution

We developed a comprehensive e-commerce transformation strategy:

### Platform Modernisation
Migrated to a headless commerce architecture with React frontend and API-driven backend, enabling faster page loads and seamless mobile experiences.

### Unified Commerce
Implemented real-time inventory synchronisation across all channels, enabling buy-online-pickup-in-store (BOPIS) and ship-from-store capabilities.

### AI-Powered Personalisation
Deployed machine learning algorithms for product recommendations, dynamic pricing, and personalised marketing campaigns.

## The Outcome

Within 12 months of launch:

- **200% increase** in online sales revenue
- **150% improvement** in mobile conversion rate
- **45% of online orders** now fulfilled from stores
- **Customer satisfaction** scores increased by 35 points

GlobalRetail Co has successfully positioned itself as an omnichannel leader, with a platform capable of scaling to meet future demand.
